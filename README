PowerDNS-DB


PowerDNS::DB - Provides an interface to manipulate PowerDNS data in the database backend. It is
a subclass of L<DBIx::Class> so anything possible in that module is possible here. Exceptions
to this rule occur when validations are used, which limit what can be entered into the database.

There are some methods that have been disabled because their functionality has not yet been
implemented. These methods will throw an error.
